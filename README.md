The all-in-one DataHack management platform, from registration to communications and voting!

## Running the development environment
1. Setup the project by running `./scripts/setup`
2. Migrate the database schemas by running `./scripts/migration apply latest`
3. If you want to populate the database then run `./scripts/backup restore lastest`

> *Note:* if you want to populate the database from a different version/file run `./scripts/backup restore <file path>`

## Deploying the project

> *Note:* This step is intended to be ran on a production server!

1. Deploy project by running `./scripts/deploy`
2. Migrate the database schemas by running `./scripts/migration apply latest`
3. Wait for backups to be pulled from AWS automatically
4. Populate the database by running `./scripts/backup restore lastest`

## Testing

To test the project we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) running through docker and X11 rendering server.

- In order to run the tests through CLI run `./scripts test cli`
- If you want to run the tests interactively you should run `./scripts test gui`

> *Note:* On macOS and Windows, and X11 server will be required, [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) is the standard X11 server for macOS and you will need to tick the [Allow connections from network clients](https://blogs.oracle.com/oraclewebcentersuite/running-gui-applications-on-native-docker-containers-for-mac) and restart Quartz.
